#Want a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. 
Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.

#Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

Make your changes in a new git branch:

   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master

Create your patch, including appropriate test cases.

Run the test suite and ensure that all tests pass.
Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our commit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

   git commit -a

Note: the optional commit -a command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

Push your branch to GitHub:

git push origin my-fix-branch
In GitHub, send a pull request to development branch

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
